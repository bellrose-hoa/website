## What is a proxy?

A proxy allows you the homeowner to designate someone who is attending the annual meeting to vote on your behalf.

## Why is this important?

If there are insufficient members and/or proxies at the annual meeting another meeting will have to be held until we reach a quorum as written in our CC&Rs.

## How can I submit a proxy?

Blank proxies are included in the annual assessment mailing. These can be returned to the HOA. Alternatively you can email your proxy to bellrosehoa@gmail.com using the template below.
