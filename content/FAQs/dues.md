## What are the HOA dues?

The HOA dues are $295.00 annually and are paid / due in January.

## What happens if we pay late?

As spelled out in the [CC&R's](/files/CCNRs.pdf) a monthly late fee of $35 is applied and a 12% APR is applied against the balance on a monthly basis.  

## What happens if we don't pay?

The HOA will apply a lien against the property.  In order to sell the account will have to be brought current to get the lien lifted.

The HOA can initate legal action to force a property sale in order to recoup dues/fees that are unpaid.

## What are the dues used for?

Insurance to cover the common areas such as the holding ponds and other common HOA grounds.  If we don't carry insurance and someone is hurt/sues the HOA then all homeowners would be liable to pay their portion of any legal / awards.

Additional the dues cover any maintanence that needs to occur during the year such as mowing/landscaping, etc.

The HOA board members are not paid as spelled out in the [CC&R's](/files/CCNRs.pdf).
